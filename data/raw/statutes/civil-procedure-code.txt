the case which is alleged against him in the 
application before any question of fact is 
entertained by the court, or its discretion 
thereon is in any degree exercised.

10. Any of the parties to an action 
which is pending in any original court may, 
before trial, and after notice in writing to 
the other parties of his intention so to do, 
apply to the Court of Appeal by motion, 
which shall be supported by affidavit setting 
out the grounds on which it is based, for the 
withdrawal of such action from the court in 
which it is pending and for the transfer of it 
for trial to any other court competent to try 
the same in respect of its nature and the 
amount or value of its subject-matter. And 
the Court of Appeal may, on any such 
application after hearing such of the parties 
as desire to be heard, and on being satisfied 
that such withdrawal and transfer are 
desirable 
for 
any 
of 
the 
following 
reasons:—
(a) that a fair and impartial trial cannot
be had in any particular court or 
place; or
(b) that some question of law of unusual
difficulty is likely to arise; or
(c) that it is expedient on any other
ground,
withdraw any such action pending in any 
such court, and transfer it for trial to any 
other such court as aforesaid, upon any 
terms that the Court of Appeal shall think 
fit. When the action might have been 
instituted in any one of several courts, the 
balance of convenience only shall be deemed 
sufficient cause for such withdrawal and 
transfer to one of the alternative courts.
In no case in which any action is so 
transferred as aforesaid from one court to 
another shall any stamp fee be leviable in 
the court to which the action is transferred 
on any pleading or exhibit on which the 
proper stamp fee has been paid in the court 
from which the action is so transferred.

plaintiffs in whom the right to any relief 
claimed is alleged to exist, whether jointly, 
severally, or in the alternative, in respect of
the same cause of action. And judgment 
may be given for such one or more of the 
plaintiffs as may be found to be entitled to 
relief for such relief as he or they may be 
entitled to, without any amendment of the 
plaint for that purpose. But the defendant 
though unsuccessful, shall be entitled to his 
costs occasioned by so joining any person 
who is not found entitled to relief, unless the 
court in disposing of the costs of the action 
otherwise directs.

undivided shares in the property in any case 
where such an action might be maintained 
by all.

in the name of the wrong person as plaintiff, 
or where it is doubtful whether it has been 
instituted in the name of the right plaintiff,

14. All persons may be joined as 
defendants against whom the right to any 
relief is alleged to exist, whether jointly,

the same cause of action. And judgment 
may be given against such one or more of 
the defendants as may be found to be liable,

personal service or (if from the number of 
parties or any other cause such service is not 
reasonably practicable, then) by public 
advertisement, as the court in each case may 
direct.
17. No action shall be defeated by 
reason of the misjoinder or non-joinder of 
parties, and the court may in every action 
deal with the matter in controversy so far as 
regards the rights and interests of the parties 
actually before it.
Nothing in this Ordinance shall be 
deemed to enable plaintiffs to join in respect 
of distinct causes of action.
If the consent of anyone who ought to be 
joined as a plaintiff cannot be obtained, he 
may be made a defendant, the reasons 
therefor being stated in the plaint.
18. (1) The court may on or before the 
hearing, upon the application of either 
party, and on such terms as the court thinks 
just, order that the name of any party, 
whether as plaintiff or as defendant 
improperly joined, be struck out; and the 
court may at any time, either upon or 
without such application, and on such terms 
as the court thinks just, order that any 
plaintiff be made a defendant, or that any 
defendant be made a plaintiff, and that the 
name of any person who ought to have been 
joined, whether as plaintiff or defendant, or 
whose presence before the court may be 
necessary in order to enable the court 
effectually and completely to adjudicate 
upon and settle all the questions involved in 
that action, be added.
(2) Every order for such amendment or 
for alteration of parties shall state the facts 
and reasons which together form the ground 
on which the order is made. And in the case 
of a party being added, the added party or 
parties shall be named, with the designation 
“ added party ”, in all pleadings or processes 
or papers entitled in the action and made 
after the date of the order.

In other cases.
Exception: 
court may 
order
separation.
35. (1) In an action for the recovery of 
immovable property, 
or to 
obtain a 
declaration of title to immovable property, 
no other claim, or any cause of action, shall 
be made unless with the leave of the court, 
except—
(a) claims in respect of mesne profits or
arrears of rent in respect of the 
property claimed;
(b) damages for breach of any contract
under which the property or any 
part 
thereof 
is 
held; 
or 
consequential on the trespass which 
constitutes the cause of action; and
(c) claims by a mortgagee to enforce any
of his remedies under the mortgage.
Example.—A sues B to recover land upon the 
allegation that the land belongs to C, and 
that he, A, has bought it of C. A makes C a 
party defendant; but he cannot, without 
leave of the court, join with this claim an 
alternative claim for damages against C for 
non-performance of his contract of sale.
(2) No claim by or against an executor, 
administrator, or heir, as such, shall in any 
action be joined with claims by or against 
him personally unless the last-mentioned 
claims are alleged to arise with reference to 
the estate in respect of which the plaintiff or 
defendant sues or is sued as executor, 
administrator, or heir, or are such as he was 
entitled to or liable for jointly with the 
deceased person whom be represents.
36. (1) Subject to the rules contained 
in the last section, the plaintiff may unite in 
the same action several causes of action 
against the same defendant or the same 
defendants jointly, and any plaintiffs having 
causes of action in which they are jointly 
interested against the same defendant or 
defendants may unite such causes of action 
in the same action.
But if it appears to the court that any 
such 
causes 
of 
action 
cannot 
be 
conveniently tried or disposed of together, 
the court may, at any time before the 
hearing, of its own motion or on the 
application of any defendant, in both cases 
either in the presence of, or upon notice to,
the plaintiff, or at any subsequent stage of 
the action if the parties agree, order separate 
trials of any such causes of action to be had, 
or make such other order as may be 
necessary or expedient for the separate 
disposal thereof.
(2) When causes of action are united, 
the jurisdiction of the court as regards the 
action shall depend on the amount or value 
of the aggregate subject-matters at the date 
of instituting the action, whether or not an 
order has been made under the second 
paragraph of subsection (1).
37. Any defendant alleging that the 
plaintiff has united in the same action 
several causes of action, which cannot be 
conveniently disposed of in one action, may 
at any time before the hearing apply to the 
court for an order confining the action to 
such of the causes of action as may be 
conveniently disposed of in one action.
38. (1) If, on the hearing of such 
application, it appears to the court that the 
causes of action are such as cannot all be 
conveniently disposed of in one action, the 
court may order any of such causes of 
action to be excluded, and may direct the 
plaint-to be amended accordingly, and may 
make such order as to costs as may be just.
(2) Every amendment made under this 
section shall be attested by the signature of 
the Judge.

the ground upon which exemption from 
such law is claimed.

amount, so far as the case admits. In an 
action for a specific chattel, or to establish, 
recover, or enforce any right, status, or 
privilege, or for mesne profits, or for the 
amount which will be found due to the 
plaintiff on taking unsettled

by name only.
46. 
(1) Every plaint presented by a Subscription of 
registered attorney on behalf of a plaintiff Plaint- 
shall be subscribed by such registered 
attorney. In every other case in which a 
plaint is presented, it shall be subscribed by 
the plaintiff; and his signature shall be 
verified by the signature of some officer 
authorized by the court in that behalf.
(2) Before the plaint (whether presented Court may 
by the plaintiff or by a registered attorney in refuse t0 
his behalf) is allowed to be filed, the court plaint 
may, if in its discretion it shall think fit, 
refuse to entertain the same for any of the 
following reasons, namely :—
(a) if it does not state correctly, and
without 
prolixity, 
the 
several 
particulars hereinbefore required to 
be specified therein;
(b) if it contains any particulars other
than those so required;
Plaintiff suing 
in a
representative 
character must 
show that the 
character has 
accrued to him.
42. 
When the plaintiff sues in a 
representative character, the plaint should 
show, not only that he has an actual existing 
interest in the subject-matter, but that he 
has taken the steps necessary to enable him 
to institute an action concerning it.
(c) if it is not subscribed, or subscribed

joined causes of action which ought 
not to be joindd in the same action,
and may return the same for amendment 
then and there, or within such time as may 
be fixed by the court, upon such terms as to 
the payment of costs occasioned by the 
amendment as the court thinks fit:
Provided that no amendment shall be 
allowed which would have the effect of 
converting an action of one character into 
an action of another and inconsistent 
character;
And provided further, that in each of the 
following cases, namely :—
(g) where 
the 
relief 
sought 
is
undervalued, and the plaintiff, on 
being required by the court to 
correct the valuation within a time 
to be fixed by the court, fails to do 
so;
(h) where the relief sought is properly 
valued, but the plaint is written 
upon paper insufficiently stamped, 
and the plaintiff on being required 
by the court to supply the requisite 
stamps within a time to be fixed by 
the court fails to do so;
(0 when the action appears from the 
statement in the plaint to be barred 
by any positive rule of law;
(j) 
when the plaint having been returned 
for amendment within a time fixed 
by the court is not amended within 
such time,
the plaint shall be rejected; but such 
rejection shall not of its own force preclude 
the plaintiff from presenting a fresh plaint in 
respect of the same cause of action.
47. 
In every case where an action has 
been instituted in a court not having 
jurisdiction by reason of the amount or
value involved, or by reason of the 
conditions made necessary to the institution 
of an action in any particular court by 
section 9 not being present, the plaint shall 
be returned to be presented to the proper 
court.
48. Every order returning or rejecting a 
plaint shall specify the date when the plaint 
was presented and so returned or rejected, 
the name of the person by whom it was 
presented and whether such person was 
plaintiff or registered attorney, and the fault 
or defect constituting the ground of return 
or rejection; and every such order shall be 
in writing signed by the Judge, and Hied of 
record.
49. (1) The plaintiff shall endorse on 
the plaint, or annex thereto, a memorandum 
•of the documents, if any, which he has 
produced along with it; and if the plaint is 
admitted, shall present as many copies on 
unstamped paper of the plaint as there are 
defendants, translated into the language of 
each defendant whose language is not the 
language of the court; unless the court, by 
reason of the length of the plaint or the 
number of the defendants or for any other 
sufficient reason, permits him to present a 
like number of concise statements of the 
nature of the claim made, or of the relief or 
remedy required in the action, in which case 
he shall present such statements.
(2) 
If the plaintiff sues or the defendant 
or any of the defendants is sued in a 
representative capacity, such statement shall 
show in what capacity such plaintiff or 
defendant sues or is sued; and the plaintiff 
may by leave of the court amend such 
statements so as to make them correspond 
with the plaint.
Such 
memorandum 
and 
copies 
or 
statements shall be examined by the 
Registrar of the court and signed by him if 
he finds them correct.
50. If a plaintiff sues upon a document 
in his possession or power, he shall produce

53. In the case of any action founded 
upon a bill of exchange, promissory note,

be proved that the instrument is lost, and if

satisfaction of the court, against the claims 
of any other person upon such instrument, 
the court may make such decree as it would 
have made if the plaintiff had produced the 
instrument in court when the plaint was 
presented, and had at the same time 
delivered a copy of the instrument to be 
filed with the plaint.

produced in court by the plaintiff when the 
plaint is presented, or to be entered in the

55. (1) Upon the plaint being filed and 
the copies or concise statements required by 
section 49 presented, the court shall order 
summons in the form No. 16 in the First 
Schedule to issue, signed by the Registrar of 
the court, requiring the defendant to answer 
the plaint on or before a day to be specified 
in the summons. The summons, together 
with such copy or concise statement each 
translated 
into 
the 
language 
of the 
defendant where his language is not the 
language of the court, attached thereto, 
shall be delivered under a precept from the 
court in the form No. 17 in the said 
Schedule, or to the like effect, to the Fiscal 
of the court or to the Fiscal of a court of
like jurisdiction within the local limits of 
whose jurisdiction the defendant resides, 
who shall cause the same to be duly served 
on the defendant, or on each defendant, if 
more than one, and shall as hereinafter 
provided, return the same and the execution 
thereof to the court, duly verified by the 
officer to whom the actual service thereof 
has been entrusted.
(2) (a) Every party to an action, not 
appearing by a registered attorney, shall on 
or before the date specified in the summons 
deliver to the Registrar a memorandum 
substantially in the form No. 16a  in the 
First Schedule setting out an address 
(hereinafter referred to as the “ registered 
address ”) for the service on him of the 
notice under section 80 and any other legal 
document required to be served on a party 
under the provisions of this Ordinance 
unless otherwise provided. Every party shall 
with such memorandum tender to the 
Registrar stamps to the value required to 
cover cost of service of such notice by 
registered post.
(b) Where a party appears by a 
registered attorney the address of the 
registered 
attorney 
contained 
in 
his
appointment shall be deemed to be the 
registered address of such party; and such 
registered attorney shall, on or before the 
date specified in the summons, tender to the 
Registrar stamps to the value required to 
cover cost of service by registered post, of 
the notice under section 80.
(c) 
The despatch by registered post to 
the registered address of a party of the 
notice under section 80, and of any other 
legal document required to be served on him 
shall be deemed to be sufficient service.
(d) 
The 
Registrar 
shall 
keep 
and 
maintain a list of the registered addresses 
furnished to him under this subsection, 
which list shall be filed as part of the record 
of the case.

SERVICE
59. * Subject to the several provisions as 
to service hereinafter in Chapter XXIII 
contained, service of the summons shall be 
made by delivering or tendering to the 
defendant personally a duplicate thereof.
60. Whenever it may be practicable, the 
service of summons shall be made on the 
defendant in person; but if, after reasonable 
exertion, the Fiscal is unable to effect 
personal service, he shall report such 
inability to the court in a fair-written return 
to the precept, having the summons 
attached thereto as an exhibit, and it shall 
be competent for the court, on being 
satisfied by evidence adduced before it that 
the defendant is within Sri Lanka, to 
prescribe any other mode of service as an 
equivalent for personal service :
Provided, however, that where such a 
return is made by the Fiscal in an action for 
the recovery of money due on the mortgage 
of immovable property, the court shall not 
under the preceding provisions of this 
section have the power to prescribe any 
other mode of service as an equivalent for 
personal 
service, 
but 
the 
following 
provisions shall apply whether or not the 
court is satisfied that the defendant is within 
Sri Lanka:—
(a) if the court is satisfied upon a 
certificate filed in that behalf by the 
registered attorney for the plaintiff 
that 
the 
mortgagor 
has 
not 
registered an address for service 
under section 30a , or if such an 
address having been registered the 
court is satisfied that the Fiscal was 
unable to effect service on such 
agent under section 64a , the court 
shall upon application made by the 
plaintiff, order that copies of the 
summons in such language as the 
court may consider appropriate 
shall be affixed by the Fiscal in at 
least three conspicuous places upon 
the mortgaged property and at the 
court-house, 
and 
may 
in 
its 
discretion direct such other acts or 
things to be done as the court may
consider appropriate (including in a 
case where an address has been 
registered under section 30a , the 
sending of a copy of the summons 
by registered post to that address);
(b) service effected in the manner 
specified in paragraph (a) shall be 
deemed to be service on the 
defendant.
61. The service substituted by order of 
the court shall be as effectual as if it had 
been made on the defendant personally.
62. Whenever service is substituted by 
order of the court, the court shall fix a day 
on or before which the defendant shall file 
his answer and comply with the other 
requirements of section 55.
63. When there are more defendants 
than one, service of the summons shall be 
made on each defendant.
64. When a defendant has an agent 
appointed under section 30 empowered to 
accept service, service of summons on such 
agent shall be sufficient. And in the case of 
an action against partners relative to a 
partnership transaction, or to an actionable 
wrong in respect of which relief is claimable 
from the partners, as a firm, each partner is 
an agent so empowered of each other 
partner, as is also the person (if any) not 
being a partner, who has the management of 
the business of the partnership at the 
principal place of such business within the 
local 
limits 
of 
the 
court’

ordinary

Nothing in the preceding provisions of 
this section shall be deemed to authorize 
summons in an action to recover moneys 
due on a mortgage of immovable property 
to be served on any agent appointed under 
section 30.
64A. Where 
the 
mortgagor 
has 
registered the address of an agent under 
section 30A, service of summons may be 
made on such agent and shall be sufficient.

129. Every summons to a person to give

hereinbefore prescribed for the service of

made a sufficient time before the time 
specified in the summons for the attendance 
of the person summoned, to allow him a 
reasonable time for preparation and for 
travelling to the place at which his 
attendance is required.
131. (1) If the Fiscal returns to the 
court that the summons for the attendance 
of a person, either to give evidence or to 
produce a document, cannot be served, the 
court may take evidence touching the 
non-service.
And upon being satisfied that such 
evidence or production is material, and that 
the person for whose attendance the 
summons has been issued is absconding, or 
keeping out of the way for the purpose of 
avoiding the service of summons, the court 
may in its discretion either issue a warrant 
for the apprehension of such witness or may 
issue a proclamation requiring him to attend 
to give evidence, or produce the document, 
at a time and place to be named therein; 
and a copy of such proclamation shall be 
affixed on the outer door of the house in 
which he ordinarily resides.
(2) If he does not attend at the time and

on a day to be appointed ; and may examine 
him as a witness, or require him to produce

is summoned to appear and give evidence in 
an action must attend at the time and place 
named in the summons for that purpose, 
and whoever is summoned to produce a

or cause it to be produced, at such time and

state the same in the form of an issue, and 
the court shall proceed to determine the

(2) If the parties, however, are not so 
agreed, the court shall, upon the allegations 
made in the plaint, or in answer to

upon the contents of documents produced 
by either party, and after such examination 
of the parties as may appear necessary,

of fact or of law the parties are at variance, 
and shall thereupon proceed to record the

(3) Nothing in this section requires the 
court to frame and record issues when the 
defendant makes no defence.
Provided that, when the hearing of 
evidence has once begun, the hearing of the

144. If on any day to which the hearing

of them fail to appear, the court may

the modes directed in that behalf by 
Chapter XII, or make such other order as it

evidence.
Cross-
examination.
153. Then shall follow re-examination Re- 
by the first side if required, for the purpose examination, 
of enabling the witness to explain such 
answers given by him on cross-examination 
as may have left facts imperfectly stated by 
him, and to add such further facts as may 
have been suggested and made admissible 
by the cross-examination.
Explanation.—During 
the 
course 
of 
the 
examination, cross-examination, and re­
examination, the court ought not, as a 
general rule, to interfere, except when 
necessary 
for the 
purpose 
of causing 
questions to be put in a clear and proper 
shape, of checking improper questions and 
of making the witness give precise answers.
At the end of it, however, if it has been 
reasonably well conducted, the court ought 
to know fairly the position of the witness 
with regard to the material facts of the case, 
and it should then put such questions to the 
witness as it may consider necessary to 
possess itself of all the detailed relevant facts 
to which the witness can speak from 
personal observation, or which bear upon his 
trustworthiness.
150. The party having the right to begin 
shall state his case, giving the substance of 
the facts which he proposes to establish by 
his evidence.
Explanation 1.—The plaintiff has the right to begin 
unless where the defendant admits the facts 
alleged by the plaintiff, and contends that 
either in point of law or on some additional 
facts alleged by the defendant the plaintiff is 
not entitled to any part of the relief which he 
seeks, in which case the defendant has the 
right to begin.
Explanation 2. —The 
case 
enunciated 
must 
reasonably accord with the party’
s pleading, 
i.e., plaint or answer, as the case may be. 
And no party can be allowed to make at the 
trial a case materially different from that 
which he has placed on record, and which 
his opponent is prepared to meet. And the 
facts proposed to be established must in the 
whole amount to so much of the material 
part of his case as is not admitted in his 
opponent’
s pleadings.
151. After stating his case in person, or 
by his registered attorney or counsel, the 
same party shall produce his evidence, 
calling his witnesses and by questions 
eliciting from each of them the relevant and 
material facts to which such witness can 
speak of his own observation.
Explanation.—The questions should be simple, and 
so framed as to obtain from the witnesses, as 
nearly as may be in a chronological order, a 
narrative of all the facts relevant to the 
matter in issue between the parties which he 
has witnessed—i.e., which he has in any 
manner directly observed or perceived, and 
no others. -And on any disputed point the 
questions should not be such as to lead, or 
suggest, the answer; nor such as to induce a 
witness, other than an expert, to state a 
conclusion of his reasoning, an inference of 
fact, or a matter of belief, in the place of 
describing what he actually observed.
Also, a general request to a witness to tell what he 
knows, or to state the facts of the case, is, as 
a rule, not to be permitted, because it gives 
an opening for a prepared story.
Nothing in this explanation operates to prevent a 
witness from stating hearsay, or giving any 
opinion, where the hearsay or opinion is a 
relevant fact in the case.
152. After the examination-in-chief by 
the party who called the witness, the cross- 
examination 
of the same witness, 
if 
required, shall in like manner be effected by 
the opposite side, only that in this case 
leading questions may be put.
154. (1) Every document or writing Tender of
which a party intends to use as evidence documents
in evidence
against his opponent must be formally 
tendered by him in the course of proving his 
case at the time when its contents or purport 
are first immediately spoken to by a witness.
If it is an original document already filed in 
the record of some action, or the deposition 
of a witness made therein, it must previously 
be procured from that record by means of, 
and under an order from, the court. If it is a 
portion of the pleadings, or a decree or 
order of court made in another action, it 
shall not generally be removed therefrom, 
but a certified copy thereof shall be used in 
evidence instead.
(2) It shall not be competent to the court Records of

[Cap. 105
Procedure to 
be followed 
before witness 
is asked to 
identify 
document.
shall cause it, or so much of it as the parties 
may desire, to be read aloud.
Explanation.—If 
the opposing party does not, on the 
document being tendered in evidence, object 
to its being received, and if the document is 
not such as is forbidden by law to be 
received in evidence, the court should admit 
it.
If, however, on the document being tendered the 
opposing party objects to its being admitted 
in evidence, then commonly two questions 
arise for the court:—
Firstly, whether the document is authentic—in 
other words, is what the party 
tendering it represents it to b e; and
Secondly, whether, supposing it to be authentic, 
it 
constitutes 
legally 
admissible 
evidence as against the party who is 
sought to be affected by it.
The latter question in general is matter of 
argument only, but the first must be 
supported by such testimony as the 
party can adduce. If the court is of 
opinion that the testimony adduced 
for this purpose, developed and tested 
by cross-examination, makes out a 
prima facie case of authenticity and is 
further of opinion that the authentic 
document 
is 
evidence 
admissible 
against the opposing party, then it 
should admit the document as before.
If, however, the court is satisfied that either of 
those questions must be answered in 
the negative, then it should refuse to 
admit the document.
Whether the document is admitted or not it 
should be marked as soon as any 
witness 
makes a statement 
with 
regard to i t ; and if not earlier marked 
on this account, it must, at least, be 
marked when the court decides upon 
admitting it.
155. 
Before a witness is allowed to, in 
any way, identify a document, he should 
generally be made, by proper questioning, 
to state the grounds of his knowledge with 
regard to it.
Illustration
If the witness is about to speak to the act, or factum, 
of signature he should first be made to 
explain concisely the occurrences which led 
to his being present on the occasion of the 
signing; and if he is about to recognize a 
signature on the strength of his knowledge of 
the supposed signer’
s handwriting, he should 
first be made to state the mode in which this 
knowledge was acquired.
156. The questioning for this purpose 
should be effected by the party who is 
seeking to prove the document; and the 
opposing party, if he desires to do so, 
should be allowed to interpose with cross- 
examination on this point before the 
document is shown to the witness.
157. It is the duty of the court, in the 
event of a witness professing to be able to 
recognize or identify writing, always to take 
care that his capacity to do so is thus tested, 
unless the opposite party admits it.
158. If on the examination effected for 
this purpose it appears to the court that the 
witness was not in fact present at the time of 
signing, or is not reasonably competent to 
identify the handwriting, then the court 
shall not permit him to give his testimony 
on the matter of the signature.
159. (1) The signature of a person, 
which purports or which appears by the 
evidence to have been written by the pen of 
another, is not proved until both the fact of 
the writing and the authority of the writer to 
write the name on the document as a 
signature is proved.
(2) Subsection (1) applies to the case 
where the signature is a mark explained by 
the name written adjacent thereto.
160. In the case of an illiterate person, 
who cannot read, it must also be proved 
that at the time when his name was written 
on, or his mark put to, the document, he 
understood the contents of it:
Provided that where the name of such 
illiterate person shall have been written on, 
or his mark put to, any document for the 
purpose merely of attesting the signature of 
qnother, it shall not be necessary to prove 
that he understood the contents of such 
document, but it shall be sufficient to prove 
that he was aware of the purpose for which 
his name was so written or his mark so put, 
and that the person whose signature he 
purports to attest was known to him.
161. When the document purports on 
the face of it to be so old that proof of the 
actual execution is not required by law, it is 
not proved until sufficient evidence has been

from the proper custody, and that it has

proper 
custody 
throughout the period during which it can 
be reasonably accounted for.
162. When the document, the admission 
of which is objected to, is put forward as the 
copy of an absent original, it is not proved 
until both such evidence as is sufficient to 
prove the correctness of the copy, and also 
such evidence as would be sufficient to 
prove the original, had it been tendered 
instead of the copy, has been given.
Note.—The question whether a copy document is 
admissible in evidence between the parties in the place- 
of the original is quite distinct from the question 
whether the document (original or copy) is admissible 
as evidence relevant to the issue under trial.
163. When the party beginning has 
stated his case and adduced his evidence in 
accordance with the foregoing rules, then 
the opposing party or parties (if there are 
more than one, who have distinct cases) 
shall in person, or by registered attorney or 
counsel, state his or their case or cases (and 
in the latter event in succession), and when 
the case of each opposing party has been so 
stated each such party shall adduce in order 
his evidence, oral and documentary, and the 
same shall be received and dealt with 
precisely as in the case of the party 
beginning, who shall then be entitled to 
reply. But where there are several issues, the 
burden of proving some of which lies on the 
other party or parties, the party beginning 
may at his option either produce his 
evidence on those issues or reserve it by way 
of answer to the evidence produced by the 
opposing party or parties ; and in the latter 
case the party beginning may produce 
evidence on those issues after the other 
party or parties has or have produced all his 
or their evidence, and such other party or 
parties may then reply specially on the 
evidence 
so 
produced 
by 
the 
party 
beginning, but the party beginning will in 
that case be entitled to reply generally on 
the whole case.
164. The court may at any time, whether 
before or after the examination of a witness 
by the respective parties or during such 
examination, 
put 
and 
interpose 
such 
questions as it may consider conducive to 
the attainment of truth and justice. And the
answers to such questions shall be made' to 
appear on the face of the record as having 
been given to the court.
165. The court may also in its discretion 
recall any witness, whose testimony has 
been taken, for further examination or 
cross-examination, whenever in the course 
of the-trial it thinks it necessary for the ends 
of 
justice to do so.
166. The court may for grave cause, to 
be recorded by it at the time, permit a 
departure from the course of trial prescribed 
in the foregoing rules.
167. The evidence of the witnesses shall 
be given orally, as above prescribed, in open 
court in the presence and under the personal 
direction and superintendence of the Judge.
168. Witnesses 
professing 
to 
be 
Christians or Jews, who have discretion to 
understand the nature of an oath, shall be 
examined upon oath, unless they state that, 
according to their religious tenets or on 
other grounds they object to the taking of 
an oath, in which case they shall be 
examined on affirmation. Witnesses not 
professing to be Christians or Jews shall be 
examined on affirmation. The same rule 
shall apply to affidavits. And except when 
hereinafter otherwise expressly provided, 
the 
oath 
or

shall

be taken down in writing by the Judge, or in

evidence shall be taken down ordinarily in 
the form of a narrative.
170. The court may of its own motion 
or on the application of any party take 
down or cause to be taken down any 
particular question and answer, or any 
objection to any question, if there appear to 
the court any special reason for so doing.
171. If any question put to a witness be 
objected to, and the court allows the same

respecting

174. The witnesses on either side or on 
both or all sides shall, on motion of any of 
the parties, be kept out of court and 
of hearing, except the witness immediately 
under examination; nor shall any witness, 
who shall remain in court or within hearing 
after order made to that effect, be permitted 
to give evidence, unless in the case of a 
witness called to prove some fact which has 
incidentally become essential in the course 
of the trial, and the necessity of which could 
not reasonably have been anticipated. And 
every witness who has been examined shall 
be kept separate from, and shall be allowed 
no communication with, those who still 
remain to be examined :
Provided that it shall be lawful for the 
court in its discretion to allow any witness 
to be examined, if it shall think such 
examination conducive to the attainment of 
truth or justice, notwithstanding that such 
witness shall have remained in court or 
within hearing contrary to such order 
aforesaid.
175. (1) No witness shall be called on 
behalf of any party unless such witness shall 
have been included in the list of witnesses 
previously filed in court by such party as 
provided by section 121 :
Provided, however, that the court may in 
its discretion, 
if special circumstances 
appear to it to render such a course 
advisable in the interests of justice, permit a 
witness to be examined, although such 
witness may not have been included in such 
list aforesaid;
Provided also that any party to an action 
may be called as a witness without his name 
having been included in any such list.
(2) A document which is required to be 
included in the list of documents filed in 
court by a party as provided by section 121 
and which is not so included shall not, 
without the leave of the court, be received in 
evidence at the trial of the action:
Provided that nothing in this subsection 
shall apply to documents produced for cross 
examination of the witnesses of the opposite 
party or handed over to a witness merely to 
refresh his memory.
176. The court may forbid any questions 
or inquiries which it regards as indecent or 
scandalous, although such questions or 
inquiries may have some bearing on the 
questions before the court, unless they relate 
to facts in issue or to matters necessary to 
be known in order to determine whether or 
not the fact in issue existed.
177. The court shall forbid any question 
which appears to it to be intended to insult 
or annoy, or which, though proper in itself, 
appears to the court needlessly offensive in 
form.
178. (1) If a witness is about to leave 
the jurisdiction of the court, or if other 
sufficient cause is shown to the satisfaction 
of the court why his evidence should be 
taken immediately, the court may upon the 
application of either party or of the witness, 
at any time after the institution of the action 
and before trial, take the evidence of such 
witness in manner hereinbefore provided.
(2) Where such evidence is not taken 
forthwith, and in the presence of the parties, 
such notice as the court thinks sufficient of 
the day fixed for the examination shall be 
given to the parties.
(3) The evidence so taken may be read at 
any hearing of the action, provided that the 
witness cannot then be produced.
179. The court may at any time, for 
sufficient reason, order that any particular 
fact or facts may be proved by affidavit, or 
by depositions 
taken 
on commission, 
instead of by the testimony of witnesses 
given viva voce before it, or that the

of the parties, correct any clerical or 
arithmetical mistake in any Judgment or 
order or any error arising therein from any 
accidental slip or omission, or may make 
any amendment which-is necessary to bring 
a decree into conformity with the judgment.
(2) Reasonable notice of any proposed 
amendment under this section shall in all 
cases be given to the parties or their 
registered attorneys.
190. Where 
the 
decree 
relates 
to 
immovable property the property affected 
thereby shall be described therein by the 
boundaries and in such other manner by 
reference to surveys or otherwise as may 
secure, as far as possible, correctness of 
identification; and the description shall be 
in such form as to enable such decree to be 
registered 
under 
the 
Registration of 
Documents Ordinance.
191. When the action is for movable 
property, if the decree be for the delivery of 
such property, it shall also state the amount 
of money to be paid as an alternative, if 
delivery cannot be had.
192. (1) When the action is for a sum 
of money due to the plaintiff, the court may, 
in the decree order interest according to the 
rate agreed on between the parties by the 
instrument sued on, or in the absence of any 
such agreement at the rate of twelve per 
centum per annum to be paid on the 
principal sum adjudged from the date of the 
action to the date of the decree, in addition 
to any interest adjudged on such principal 
sum for any period prior to the institution 
of the action, with further interest at such 
rate on the aggregate sum so adjudged, from 
the date of the decree to the date of 
payment, or to such earlier date as the court 
thinks fit.
(2) When such a decree is silent with 
respect to the payment of further interest on 
such aggregate sum as aforesaid from the 
date of the decree to the date of payment or 
other earlier date, the court shall be deemed 
to have refused such interest, and a separate 
action therefor shall not lie.
193. When the action is for damages for 
breach of contract, if it appear that the 
defendant is able to perform the contract, 
the court, with the consent of the plaintiff, 
may decree the specific performance of the 
contract within a time to be fixed by the 
court, and in such case shall award an 
amount of damages to be paid as an 
alternative if the contract is not performed.
194. In all decrees for the payment of 
money, except money due on mortgage of 
movable or immovable property, the court 
may order that the amount decreed to be 
due shall be paid by instalments, with or 
without interest, and the court may in its 
discretion impose such terms as it may think 
fit as to giving security for the payments so 
to be made:
Provided always that on failure to pay the 
first or any other instalment, the whole 
amount or any balance then due shall on 
such failure become immediately payable;
Provided also, that if the party ordered to 
pay by instalments shall appeal against the 
decree, and the appeal shall be decided 
against him, his right to pay by instalments 
shall cease, and the whole amount shall be 
immediately payable, unless the Court of 
Appeal or the Supreme Court, as the case 
may be, give express direction to the 
contrary;
Provided also, that no appeal shall lie 
against the refusal of the court to make an 
order for payment by instalments.
195. If the defendant shall have been 
allowed to set off any demand against the 
claim of the plaintiff, the decree shall state 
what amount is due to the plaintiff and 
what amount (if any) is due to the 
defendant, and the mandatory part of the 
decree shall be for the recovery of any 
balance which shall on that statement 
appear to be due to either party. The decree 
of the court with respect to anything 
awarded to the defendant on any matter on 
which the defendant obtains judgment by 
set-off or in reconvention, shall be to the 
same effect, and be subject to the same 
rules, as if such thing had been claimed by 
the defendant in a separate action against 
the plaintiff.

whenever the prayer of the plaint asks for 
damages in respect of mesne profits or rent, 
provide in the decree for the payment of 
money in lieu of mesne profits or rent in 
respect of such property from the date of 
the institution of the action until the 
delivery of possession to the party in whose 
favour the decree is made, with interest 
thereon at such rate not exceeding twelve 
per centum as the court thinks fit.
Explanation:— “ Mesne profits ” of property mean 
those profits which the person in wrongful 
possession 
of 
such 
property 
actually 
received, or might, with ordinary diligence, 
have received therefrom.
197. When the action is for the recovery 
of possession of immovable property and 
for mesne profits which have accrued 
thereon during a period prior to the 
institution of the action, the court may 
either determine the amount and make an 
order for the payment thereof additional to 
and embodied in the decree itself, or may 
pass a decree for the property and reserve 
the inquiry into the amount of mesne profits 
to be entered upon after the execution of the 
decree for the property, as may appear most 
convenient.
198. When the action is for an account 
of 
any 
property 
and 
for 
its 
due 
administration under the decree of the 
court, the court, before making the final 
decree between the parties, shall order such 
accounts and inquiries to be taken and 
made, and give such other directions, as it 
thinks fit.
199. In the administration by the court 
of the property of any person who dies after 
this Ordinance comes into force, if such 
property proves to be insufficient for the 
payment in full of his debts and liabilities, 
the same rules shall be observed as to the 
respective rights of secured and unsecured 
creditors, and as to debts and liabilities 
provable, and as to the valuation of 
annuities and future and contingent
liabilities respectively as may be in force for 
the time being with respect to the estates of 
persons adjudged insolvent.
And all persons who in any such case 
would be entitled to be paid out of such 
property may come in under the decree for 
its administration and make such claims 
against the same as they may respectively be 
entitled to by virtue of this Ordinance.
200. When the action is to enforce a 
right of pre-emption in respect of a 
particular sale of property, and the court 
finds for the plaintiff, if the amount of 
purchase money has not been paid into 
court, the decree shall specify a day on or 
before which it shall be so paid, and shall 
declare that on payment of such purchase 
money, together with the costs (if any) 
decreed against him, the plaintiff shall 
obtain possession of the property, but that if 
such money and costs are not so paid" on or 
before such day or any extension thereof 
which shall have been allowed for good 
cause shown, the action shall stand 
dismissed with costs.
202*. When the action is for the 
dissolution of partnership, the court before 
making its decree may pass an order fixing 
the day on which the partnership shall stand 
dissolved, and directing such accounts to be 
taken and other acts to be done as it thinks 
fit.
203. When the action is for an account 
of pecuniary transactions between principal 
and agent, and in all other actions not 
hereinbefore provided for, where it is 
necessary in order to ascertain the amount 
of money due to or from any party that an 
account should be taken, the court shall 
before making its decree pass an order 
directing such account to be taken as it 
thinks fit.
204. When a decree or order made at 
the hearing of the action is such as to have 
the effect of postponing the further hearing 
and the final determination of the action, as 
for instance a decree for the taking of 
accounts, or an order for the issue of a

which passed the decree or order.
242. The claim or objection shall be 
made at the earliest opportunity, and if the 
property to which the claim or objection 
applies shall have been advertised for sale, 
the sale may (if it appears to the court 
necessary) be postponed for the purpose of 
making the investigation mentioned in 
section 241 :
Provided that no such investigation shall 
be made if it appears to the court that the 
making of the claim or objection was 
designedly and unnecessarily delayed with a 
view to obstruct the ends of justice.
243. The claimant or objector must on 
such investigation adduce evidence to show 
that at the date of the seizure he had some 
interest in, or was possessed of, the property 
seized.
244. If upon the said investigation the 
court is satisfied that, for the reason stated 
in the claim or objection such property was 
not, when seized, in the possession of the 
judgment-debtor, or of some person in trust 
for him or in the occupancy of a tenant or 
other person paying rent to him, or that 
being in the possession of the judgment- 
debtor at such time, it was so in his 
possession, not on his own account or as his 
own property, but on account of or in trust 
for some other person, or partly on his own 
account and partly on account of some 
other person, the court shall release the 
property wholly, or to such extent as it 
thinks fit, from seizure and make such order 
as to payment of fees and charges already 
incurred by the Fiscal as it may deem fit.
245. If the court is satisfied that the 
property was, at the time it was seized, in 
possession of the judgment-debtor as his 
own property, and not on account of any 
other person or was in the possession of 
some other person, in trust for him, or in 
the occupancy of a tenant or other person 
paying rent to him, the court shall disallow 
the claim.
246. If the court is satisfied that the 
property is subject to a mortgage or lien in 
favour of some person not in possession, 
and thinks fit to continue the sequestration 
or seizure, it may do so subject to such 
mortgage or lien.

declared liable to be sold in execution of the

248. Whenever it shall appear to a 
competent court, and be so found and 
declared in any judgment pronounced by it 
in any action instituted by or against any 
person claiming any property pointed out or 
seized in execution, that such claim is 
altogether groundless, and wilfully preferred 
only to defeat or delay the execution, every 
such claimant shall, in addition to his 
liability to pay costs and damages, be liable 
to a fine not exceeding fifty rupees, and 
such fine shall be recovered as a fine 
imposed by a court in a criminal case.
249. When a Fiscal has seized property 
of a partnership before or after its 
dissolution, upon a writ of execution against 
the interest therein of any partner made by 
virtue of ah execution against his individual 
property, any other partner or former 
partner having an interest in the property 
may, at any time before the sale, apply to 
the court from which the writ of execution 
issued, upon an affidavit showing the facts, 
for an order directing the Fiscal to release 
the property and to deliver it to the 
applicant.
250. Upon such an application- the 
applicant must give an undertaking, with at 
least two sureties, approved by the Judge, to 
the effect that he will account to the 
purchaser upon the sale to be made by 
virtue of the execution of the interest of the 
judgment-debtor in the property seized, in 
like manner as he would be bound to 
account to an assignee of such an interest; 
and that he will pay to the purchaser the 
balance which may be found due upon the 
accounting, not exceeding a sum specified in 
the undertaking, which must be not less 
than the value of the interest of the 
judgment-debtor in the property seized by 
the Fiscal as fixed by the Judge.
251. Where property of a partnership 
has been released upon an undertaking as 
prescribed in the last two sections, if the 
execution by virtue of which the levy was 
made is set aside or is satisfied without a 
sale of the interest levied upon, the 
undertaking enures to the benefit of each 
judgment-creditor of the same judgment- 
debtor then having an execution in the 
hands of the Fiscal having authority to levy 
upon that interest, as if it had been given to 
obtain a release from a seizure made by 
virtue of such an execution.
252. Where property of a partnership 
has been so released, the interest of the 
judgment-debtor therein may be sold by the 
Fiscal, and the purchaser upon the sale 
acquires all that interest as if he was an 
assignee thereof.

(1) If at any time prior to the sale 
of immovable property seized in execution 
the judgment-debtor can satisfy the court 
that there is reason to believe that the 
amount of the decree and of any unsatisfied 
judgment then in force against him may be 
raised by mortgage, or lease, or private sale 
of such property, or some part thereof, or of 
any other immovable property of the 
judgment-debtor, the court may on his 
application postpone the sale of such 
property for such period as it thinks proper

and charges due to the Fiscal as it may 
deem fit.

decree for the possession of movable or 
immovable property the Fiscal is resisted or 
obstructed by the judgment-debtor or any 
other person, or where after the officer has 
delivered possession, the judgment-creditor 
is hindered or ousted by the judgment- 
debtor or any other person in taking 
complete and effectual possession thereof, 
and in the case of immovable property, 
where the judgment-creditor has been so 
hindered or ousted within a period of one 
year and one day, the judgment-creditor 
may at any time within one month from the 
date of such resistance or obstruction or 
hindrance or ouster, complain thereof to the 
court by a petition in which the judgment- 
debtor and the person, if any, resisting or 
obstructing or hindering or ousting shall be 
named 
respondents. 
The 
court 
shall 
thereupon serve a copy of such petition on 
the parties named therein as respondents 
and require such respondents to file 
objections, if any, within such time as they 
may be directed by court.
(2) When a petition under subsection (1) 
is presented, the court may, upon the 
application of the judgment-creditor made 
by motion ex parte, direct the Fiscal to 
publish a notice announcing that the Fiscal 
has been resisted or obstructed in delivering 
possession of such property, or that the 
judgment-creditor has been hindered in 
taking complete and effectual possession 
thereof or ousted therefrom, as the case may

affixing a copy of the notice in the language 
of the court, and, where the language of the 
court is also Tamil, in that language, in 
some conspicuous place on the property and 
proclaiming in the customary mode or in 
such manner as the court may direct, the 
contents of the notice. A copy of such notice 
shall be affixed to the court-house and if the 
court so orders shall also be published in 
any daily newspaper as the court may direct.
(4) Any person claiming to be in 
possession of the whole of the property or 
part thereof as against the judgment- 
creditor may file a written statement of his 
claim within fifteen days of the publication 
of the notice on such property, setting out 
his right or interest entitling him to the 
present possession of the whole property or 
part thereof and shall serve a copy of such 
statement on the judgment-creditor. The 
investigation into such claim shall be taken 
up along with the inquiry into the petition 
in respect of the resistance, obstruction, 
hindrance or ouster complained of, after 
due notice of the date of such investigation 
and inquiry has been given to all persons 
concerned.

392. 
The 
death 
of a 
plaintiff or 
defendant shall not cause the action to abate 
if the right to sue on the cause of action 
survives.
393. 
If there be more plaintiffs or 
defendants than one and any of them dies, 
and if the right to sue on the cause of action 
survives to the surviving plaintiff or 
plaintiffs alone, or against the surviving 
defendant or defendants alone, the court 
shall, on application in the way of summary 
procedure, make an order to the effect that 
the action do proceed at the instance of the 
surviving plaintiff or plaintiffs, or against 
the surviving defendant or defendants.
394. (1) If there are more plaintiffs 
than one, and any of them dies, and if the 
right to sue does not survive to the surviving 
plaintiff or plaintiffs alone, but survives to 
him or them and the legal representative of 
the deceased plaintiff jointly, the court may 
cause the legal representative, if any, of the 
deceased plaintiff to be made a party, and 
shall thereupon cause an entry to that effect 
to be made on the record and proceed with 
the action.
(2) For the purposes of this Chapter—
“ estate ” means the gross value of the 
estate of the deceased ; and
“ legal representative ” means an executor 
or administrator, or in the case of 
an estate below the value of twenty 
thousand rupees, the next of kin 
who have adiated the inheritance.
395. In case of the death of a sole 
plaintiff or sole surviving plaintiff the legal 
representative of the deceased may, where 
the right to sue survives, apply to the court 
to have his name entered on the record in 
place of the deceased plaintiff, and the court 
shall thereupon enter his name and proceed 
with the action.
396. If no such application be made to 
the court by any person claiming to be the 
legal representative of the deceased plaintiff, 
the court may pass an order that the action 
shall abate, and award to the defendant the 
costs which he may have incurred in 
defending the action, to be recovered from 
the estate of the deceased plaintiff; or the 
court may, if it think proper, on the 
application of the defendant, and upon such 
terms as to costs or otherwise as it thinks fit, 
pass such other order as it thinks fit for 
bringing in the legal representative of the 
deceased plaintiff or for proceeding with the 
action in order to a final determination of 
the matter in dispute, or for both those 
purposes.
397. In the event of any dispute arising 
as to who is the legal representative of a 
deceased plaintiff, it is competent to the 
court either to stay the action until the 
question has been decided in another action, 
or to decide at once, as between the parties

before it, who shall be admitted to be such 
legal representative for the purpose of 
prosecuting the action. And this question 
shall in such case be dealt with and tried by 
the court as an issue preliminary to the trial 
of the merits of the action.
398. (1) If there be more defendants 
than one, and any of them die before decree 
and the right to sue on the cause of action 
does not survive against the surviving 
defendant or defendants alone, and also in 
case of the death of a sole defendant, or sole 
surviving defendant, where the right to sue 
survives, the plaintiff may make an 
application to the court, specifying the 
name, description, and place of abode of 
any person whom he alleges to be the legal 
representative of the deceased defendant, 
and whom he desires to be made the 
defendant in his stead. The court shall 
thereupon, on being satisfied that there are 
grounds therefor, enter the name of such 
representative on the record in the place of 
such defendant, and shall issue a summons 
to such representative to appear on a day to 
be therein mentioned to defend the action, 
and the case shall thereupon proceed in the 
same manner as if such representative had 
originally been made a defendant, and had 
been a party to the former proceedings in 
the action:
Provided that the person so made 
defendant may object that he is not the legal 
representative of the deceased defendant, or 
may make any defence appropriate to his 
character as such representative.
(2) The 
legal 
representative 
of 
a 
deceased defendant may apply to have 
himself made a defendant in place of a 
deceased defendant, and the provisions of 
this section, so far as they are applicable, 
shall apply to the application and to the 
proceedings 
and 
consequences ensuing 
thereon.
399. (I) The marriage of a female 
plaintiff or defendant shall not cause the 
action to abate, but the action may, 
notwithstanding, be proceeded with to 
judgment; and where the decree is against 
.a 
female defendant, it may thereupon be 
executed against her alone.
(2) If the case is one in which the 
husband is by law liable for the debts of his 
wife, the decree may, with the permission of 
the court, be executed against the husband 
also; and in case of judgment for the wife, 
execution of the decree may, with such 
permission, be issued upon the application 
of the husband where the husband is by law 
entitled to the subject-matter of the decree.
400. The bankruptcy or insolvency of a 
plaintiff in any action which his assignee 
might maintain for the benefit of his 
creditors shall not bar the action, unless 
such assignee declines to continue the action 
and to give security for the costs thereof, 
within such time as the court may order.
401. If the assignee neglects or refuses to 
continue the action and to give such security 
within the time so ordered, the defendant 
may apply for the dismissal of the action on 
the ground of the plaintiffs bankruptcy or 
insolvency, and the court may dismiss the 
action and award to the defendant the costs 
which he has incurred in defending the 
same, to he proved as a debt against the 
plaintiffs estate.
402. If a period 
exceeding twelve 
months in the case of a District Court or 
Family Court, or six months in a Primary 
Court, elapses subsequently to the date of 
the last entry of an order or proceeding in 
the record without the plaintiff taking any 
steps to prosecute the action where any such 
step is necessary, the court may pass an 
order that the action shall abate.
403. When an action abates or is 
dismissed under this Chapter, no fresh 
action shall be brought on the same cause of 
action.
But the plaintiff or the person claiming to 
be the legal representative of a deceased or 
insolvent plaintiff may, within such period 
of time as may seem to the court under the 
circumstances of the case to be reasonable, 
apply for an order to set aside the order for 
abatement or dismissal; and if it be proved 
that he was prevented by any sufficient 
cause from continuing the action the court 
shall set aside the abatement or dismissal 
upon such terms as to costs or otherwise as 
it thinks fit.

Of  t h e  Wit h d r a w a l  a n d  
Ad ju s t m e n t  o f  Ac t io n
406. (1) If, at any time after the 
institution of the action, the court is 
satisfied on the application of the plaintiff—
(а) that the action must fail by reason of
some formal defect, or
(б) that there are sufficient grounds for
permitting him to withdraw from 
the action or to abandon part of his 
claim with liberty to bring a fresh 
action for the subject-matter of the 
action, or in respect of the part so 
abandoned,
the court may grant such permission on 
such terms as to costs or otherwise as it 
thinks fit.
(2) If the plaintiff withdraw from the 
action, or abandon part of his claim, 
without such permission, he shall be liable 
for such costs as the court may award, and 
shall be precluded from bringing a fresh 
action for the same matter or in respect of 
the same part.
(3) Nothing in this section shall be 
deemed to authorize the court to permit one 
of several plaintiffs to withdraw without the 
consent of the others.
407. In any fresh action instituted on 
permission granted under the last preceding 
section, the plaintiff shall be bound by the 
law of prescription or limitation in the same 
manner as if the first action had not been 
brought.
408. If an action be adjusted wholly or 
in part by any lawful agreement or 
compromise, or if the defendant satisfy the 
plaintiff in respect to the whole or any part 
of the matter of the action, such agreement, 
compromise, or satisfaction shall be notified 
to the court by motion made in presence of, 
or on notice to, all the parties concerned, 
and the court shall pass a decree in 
accordance therewith, so far as it relates to 
the action, and such decree shall be final, so 
far as relates to so much of the subject- 
matter of the action as is dealt with by the 
agreement, compromise, or satisfaction.

409. The 
defendant 
in 
any 
action 
brought to recover a debt or damage may, 
at any stage of the action, deposit in court 
such sum of money as he considers a 
satisfaction in full of the plaintiffs claim.
410. Notice in writing of the deposit 
shall be given by the defendant to the 
plaintiff, and the amount of the deposit 
shall (unless the court otherwise directs) be 
paid out of court to the plaintiff on his 
application.
411. No interest shall be allowed to the 
plaintiff on any sum deposited by the 
defendant from the date of the receipt of 
such notice, whether the sum deposited be 
in full of the claim or fall short thereof.
412. If the plaintiff accepts such amount 
only as satisfaction in part of his claim, he 
may prosecute his action for the balance; 
and if the court eventually decides that the 
deposit by the defendant was a full 
satisfaction of the plaintiffs claim, the 
plaintiff must pay the costs of the action 
incurred after the deposit and the costs 
incurred previous thereto, so far as they 
were caused by excess in the plaintiffs 
claim.

to apply to any

413. 
If the plaintiff accepts such amount 
as satisfaction in full of his claim, he shall 
present to the court a statement to that 
effect, embodied in a motion for judgment, 
and 
the 
court 
shall 
pass 
judgment 
accordingly, and in directing by whom the 
costs of each party are to be paid the court 
shall consider which of the parties is most to 
blame for the litigation.
Illustrations
(а) A owes B one hundred rupees. B sues A for the
amount, having made no demand for 
payment, and having no reason to believe 
that the delay caused by making a demand 
would place him at a disadvantage. On the 
plaint being filed, A pays the money into 
court. B accepts it in full satisfaction of his 
claim, but the court should not allow him 
any costs, the litigation being presumably 
groundless on his part.
(б) 
B sues A under the circumstances mentioned in
illustration (a). On the plaint being filed, A 
disputes the claim. Afterwards A pays the 
money into court. B accepts it in full 
satisfaction of his claim. The court should 
also give B his costs of action, A’
s conduct 
having 
shown 
that 
the 
litigation 
was 
necessary.
(c) 
A owes B one hundred rupees, and is willing to 
pay him that sum without action. B claims 
one hundred and fifty rupees, and sues A for 
that amount. On the plaint being filed, A 
pays one hundred rupees into court, and 
disputes only his liability to pay the 
remaining fifty rupees. B accepts the one 
hundred rupees in full satisfaction of his 
claim. The court should order him to pay A’
s 
costs.
414. When a defendant by his answer or 
any party to an action by petition professes 
to pay money into court, or when a 
defendant by his answer sets up a tender of 
any sum of money before action brought, 
the answer or the petition shall not be 
received or filed by the court unless either 
the sum of money so professed to have been 
paid into court, or so alleged to have been 
teiidered, is actually paid into court, or the 
requisite steps for the purpose are taken by 
the defendant or other party, as the case 
may be.
415. The enactments of this Chapter 
shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the case of 
payment of money into court made by any 
party to the action in satisfaction of the 
claim of any other party.

(2) When an action is dismissed under Dismissal may

defendant, apply for an order to set the 
dismissal aside, and if it is proved to the 
satisfaction of the court that he was 
prevented by any sufficient cause from 
furnishing the security within the time 
allowed, the court shall set aside the 
dismissal upon such terms as to security, 
costs, or otherwise as it thinks fit, and shall 
appoint a day for proceeding with the 
action.

letters of administration, as the case may be, 
upon production of a provisional certificate 
under the provisions of subsection (3) of 
section 531 A.
532.

in the petition or not, direct notice of the 
order nisi in the form No. 84A in the First 
Schedule to be advertised twice in a local 
newspaper before the day of final hearing, 
the newspaper to be selected by the court 
with the object that the notice of the order 
nisi should come to the knowledge of all 
persons interested in the administration of 
the deceased’s property:
Provided that the court may in its 
discretion direct such other mode of 
advertisement in lieu of such publication as 
to it seems sufficient.
533. If on the day appointed for final 
hearing, or on the day to which it may have 
been duly adjourned the respondent or any 
person upon whom the order nisi has been 
directed to be served, or any person then

requires it to enter into a bond with two- 
good and sufficient sureties in the form No.

property.
(2) The bond so entered into shall 
render the sureties responsible in any suit 
brought for the administration of the

for 
all 
deficiencies, depreciation, or loss of that 
property attributable to the default of their

539. 
It is competent to the District Court 
to make a grant of probate or a grant of 
administration, limited either in respect to its 
duration, or in respect to the property to be 
administered thereunder, or to the power of 
dealing with that property which is conveyed 
by the grant, in the following cases :—
(a) When the original will of the
deceased person has been lost since 
the testator’
s death, but a copy has 
been preserved, probate of that copy 
may be granted, limited until the 
original be brought into court.
(b) In the like event, and with the like
limitation, if no copy has been 
preserved, probate of a draft will 
may be granted, or if in addition no 
draft is available, then probate of 
the contents or of the Substance and 
effect of the will, so far as they can 
be established by evidence, may be 
granted.
(c) When the original will is in the hands
of some person residing out of Sri 
Lanka, who cannot be compelled to 
give it up to the executor, and if the 
executor produces a copy, then 
probate of that copy may be 
granted, limited until the original be 
brought into court. If, however, the 
will has been duly proved out of Sri 
Lanka, probate may be granted to 
the 
executor 
on 
a 
proper 
exemplification 
of 
the 
foreign 
probate without any limitation in 
the grant.
(d) If the sole executor of a will resides, 
or if there- are more executors than 
one and all the executors reside, out 
of Sri Lanka, or such of the 
executors as reside in Sri Lanka 
decline to act, then the court may 
grant administration with copy of 
the will annexed to any person 
within Sri Lanka, as attorney of the 
executor or of the executors, who 
shall be appointed for that purpose 
by power of attorney, the grant so 
made being limited for the use and 
benefit of the principal until the 
executor or one of the executors 
comes in and obtains probate for 
himself. If the document admitted 
to proof in this case be a copy of or 
substitute for the original, on 
account of the original itself not 
being forthcoming 
by reason of 
one of the just-mentioned causes, 
the grant shall further be limited 
until the original is brought into 
court:
Provided also, that if the person 
applying for the grant is not the 
attorney of all the executors, where 
there are more than one, the grant 
of administration shall not be made 
to 
him 
until 
the 
remaining 
executors have declined to act.
(e) In the case of a will, and there being
no executor within Sri Lanka 
willing 
to 
act, 
grant 
of 
administration with copy of the will 
annexed may be made to the 
attorney of an absent residuary

limited during the minority, or to 
the manager of the estate of a 
residuary legatee who is of unsound 
mind, within Sri Lanka, limited 
during the unsoundness of mind.
(/) In the case of intestacy, grants of 
administration of the deceased 
person’
s property may be made, 
limited in like manner to the 
guardian of a minor heir or to the 
manager of the estate of an heir 
who is of unsound mind.
(g) The court may grant probate or 
administration 
limited 
to 
any 
particular property or for any 
particular purpose, in any case 
where it considers that a larger 
grant is unnecessary.
In all the foregoing cases, the material 
and relevant facts necessary to justify the 
court in making the limited grant must be 
set out in the petition of application, and 
must be established by prima facie evidence 
before the order is made, as is prescribed in 
sections 524 and 530.
539A. Where 
any 
legal 
proceeding 
touching the validity of the will of a 
deceased person or for obtaining, recalling 
or revoking grant of probate or letters of 
administration is pending, the court may, 
either on the ground of undue delay or 
otherwise, grant letters of administration to 
the 
estate 
of 
the 
deceased 
to 
an 
administrator limited for the duration of 
such proceeding; such administrator shall 
be subject to the immediate control of the 
court and act under its direction, and shall 
not have the right of distributing the estate.
539B. (1) Notwithstanding 
the
provisions of section 55 of the Estate Duty 
Ordinance or of section 42 of the Estate 
Duty Act, as the case may be, where for the 
purpose of paying estate duty or for any 
other sufficient cause it becomes necessary 
to sell any property of the estate of a 
deceased person prior to the issue of 
probate or letters of administration the 
court may grant letters limited for the 
purpose of selling such property.
(2) Such property shall be specified in 
the grant and such grant shall expressly 
state that the letters are issued subject to the 
following conditions:—
(а) that the sale shall be, if by private
treaty, at the price fixed by court, 
or if by public auction, either at an 
upset price or otherwise;
(б) that the net proceeds of sale shall be
deposited in court within such time 
as the court may prescribe;
(c) that the administrator to whom the
letters are issued is not empowered 
to execute any deed of conveiyance 
of immovable property prior to the 
confirmation of sale by the court; 
and
(d) any other stipulation the court may
in the 
circumstances deem fit to 
impose.
(3) Before making an order for grant of 
letters under this section the Commissioner- 
General of Inland 
Revenue and the 
respondents to the original petition for 
probate or letters of administration shall be 
given notice of the application and they or 
any other person interested in the estate 
shall be heard in opposition unless they or 
any of them shall have signified their assent 
to such sale.
540. If no limitation is expressed in the 
order making the grant, then the power of 
administration, which is authenticated by 
the issue of probate, or is conveyed by the 
issue of a grant of administration, extends 
to every portion of the deceased person’
s 
property, movable and immovable, within 
Sri Lanka, or so much thereof as. is not 
administered, and endures for the life of the 
executor or administrator or until the whole 
of the said property is administered, 
according as the death of the executor or 
administrator, or the completion of the 
administration, first occurs.
541. In all cases of the issue of probate 
security shall not be required, unless for 
some special reason the court deems that 
security is absolutely necessary for the 
protection of the estate; and in cases where

hands of the administrator and to be liable 
to misappropriation:
Provided that every order, dispensing

duty of the widow, widower, or next of kin 
of such person, if such person shall have 
left property in Sri Lanka amounting to or 
exceeding in value twenty thousand rupees, 
within one month of the date of his death to 
report such death to the court of the district 
in which he shall have so died, and at the 
same time to make oath or affirmation or

shall wilfully omit to report such death or to 
furnish such information within the time 
therein prescribed therefor, shall be guilty of

the estate of such 
intestate administered may apply to such
court for grant- to himself of letters of 
administration; and the court shall have 
power, having regard, where there is a 
conflict of claims, to the provisions of 
section 523, 
to 
appoint such person 
administrator.
545. In case no such person shall apply 
for letters of administration, and it appears 
to the court necessary or convenient to 
appoint some person to administer the 
estate or any part thereof, it shall be lawful 
for the court in its discretion, and in every 
such case where the estate amounts to or 
exceeds in value twenty thousand rupees it 
shall be obligatory on such court, to appoint 
some person, whether he would under 
ordinary circumstances be entitled to take 
out 
administration 
or 
otherwise, 
to 
administer the estate, and all the provisions 
of sections 519 to 521, both inclusive, shall

applicable, to any such appointment.
546. If any person shall die leaving 
property in Sri Lanka, the Judge of the 
court of any district in which such property 
shall be situate shall, on the facts being 
verified to his satisfaction and it being made 
to appear that there is not resident, within 
the local limits of his jurisdiction, some next 
of kin 
or 
other 
person 
entitled 
to 
administration of the estate of the person so 
dying, issue letters ad colligenda in the form 
No. 91 in the First Schedule to one or more 
responsible persons to take charge of such 
property until the same shall be claimed by 
some executor or administrator lawfully 
entitled to administer the same.

556. (1) Whenever any person who is 
possessed of property is alleged to be a 
person of unsound mind, the District Court 
within whose jurisdiction such person is 
residing may, upon such application as is 
hereinafter mentioned, institute any inquiry 
for the purpose of ascertaining whether such 
person is or is not of unsound mind and 
incapable of managing his affairs.
(2) Application for such inquiry may be 
made on petition in the way of summary 
procedure by any relative of the person 
alleged to be of unsound mind, or by a 
Superintendent of Police, or at the instance 
of the Attorney-General, or if the property 
of the person alleged to be of unsound mind 
consists in whole or in part of land, or of 
any interest in land, by the Government 
Agent of the district in which it is situate.
557. When the District Court on such 
application being made to it is not satisfied 
by affidavit or other evidence that such 
inquiry as aforesaid ought to be instituted, it 
shall dismiss the petition.
558. When the District Court on any 
such application being made to it is satisfied 
by affidavit or other sufficient evidence that 
such inquiry as aforesaid ought to be 
instituted, it shall pass an order to that 
effect and then appoint a time and place for 
holding the inquiry.
559. As soon as such order shall have 
been passed, the District Court shall cause a 
copy of the petition and of the order made 
thereon to be served upon the person 
alleged to be of unsound mind. If it shall 
appear that the person alleged to be of 
unsound mind is in such a state that 
personal 
service 
on 
him 
would 
be 
ineffectual, the court may direct such 
substituted service of the petition and order 
as it shall think proper. The court may also 
direct a copy of such petition and order to 
be served upon any specified relative of the 
person alleged to be of unsound mind.
560. The District Court may also at any 
time before or pending the inquiry, require 
the person alleged to be of unsound mind to 
attend at such convenient time and place as 
it may appoint, for the purpose of being 
personally examined by the court or by any 
person from whom the court may desire to 
have a report of, or testimony as to, the 
mental capacity and condition of such 
person alleged to be of unsound mind. The 
court 
may 
likewise 
make 
an 
order 
authorizing any person or persons therein 
named to have access to the person alleged 
to be of unsound mind for the purpose of a 
personal examination.
561. The District Court, if it think fit, 
may appoint two or more persons to act as 
assessors to the court in the said inquiry.
562. The issue to be tried on such 
inquiry shall be whether the person alleged 
to be of unsound mind is or is not of 
unsound mind and incapable of managing 
his affairs.
563. The trial of this issue shall be 
effected by viva voce examination and 
cross-examination of witnesses, as nearly as 
may be as is hereinbefore directed for the 
trial of the matter of an ordinary civil 
action; and the inquiry, whether held in 
court or in a private house, shall be public.
564. The person alleged to be of 
unsound mind shall be present at the 
inquiry and shall take part as a party 
defendant therein either by his registered 
attorney or counsel or in person, unless his 
state of health, or his behaviour, is such as 
to render either his being present or his 
participating in the proceedings unfitting or 
unseemly.
Any relative of the person alleged to be of 
unsound mind may also, if the court thinks 
fit, appear and take part in the inquiry on 
behalf of the person alleged to be of 
unsound mind.
565. Upon 
the 
completion 
of the 
inquiry, the court shall adjudicate whether 
the person alleged to be of unsound mind is 
or is not of unsound mind and incapable of 
managing his affairs. And at the same time

delivered, and of obtaining indemnity for 
himself:
Provided that if any action is pending in 
which the rights of all parties can properly 
be decided, the stakeholder shall not 
institute an action of interpleader.
629. In every action of interpleader the 
plaint must, in addition to the other 
statements necesssary for plaints, state—
(a) that the plaintiff has no interest in
the thing claimed otherwise than as 
a mere stakeholder;
(b) the claims made by the defendants
severally; and
(c) that there is no collusion between the
plaintiff and any of the defendants;
and such plaint shall also be supported by 
an affidavit of the plaintiff verifying the 
statements contained therein.
630. When the thing claimed is capable 
of being paid into court or placed in the 
custody of the court, the plaintiff must so 
pay or place it before he can be entitled to 
any order in the action.
631. At the hearing the court may—
(a) declare 
that 
the 
plaintiff 
is
discharged from all liability to the 
defendants in respect of the thing 
claimed, award him his costs, and 
dismiss him from the action;
or if it thinks that justice or convenience so 
require—
(b) retain all parties until the final 
disposal of the action;
and if it finds that the admissions of the 
parties or other evidence enable it to do so, 
may—
(c) adjudicate upon the title to the thing
claimed;
or else it may—
(d) direct the defendants to interplead
one another by filing statements
and entering into evidence for the 
purpose of bringing their respective 
claims before the court.
632. Nothing in this Chapter shall be 
taken to enable agents to sue their principals, 
or tenants to sue their landlords, for the 
purpose of compelling them to interplead 
with any person other than persons making 
claim through such principals or landlords.

(b) A deposits a box of jewels with B as his agent.
He then writes to C for the purpose of

from himself to C. A afterwards alleges that 
C’
s debt is satisfied, and C alleges the 
contrary. Both claim the jewels from B. B 
may institute an interpleader action against 
A and C.
633. When 
the 
action 
is 
properly 
instituted, the court may provide the 
plaintiffs costs by giving him a charge on 
the thing claimed, or in some other effectual 
way.
634. If any of the defendants in an 
interpleader is actually suing the stakeholder 
in respect of the subject of such action, the 
court in which the action against the 
stakeholder is pending shall, on being duly 
informed by the court which passed the 
decree in the interpleader action in favour of 
the stakeholder, that such decree has been 
passed, stay the proceedings as against him, 
and his costs in the action so stayed may be 
provided for in such action; but if and so 
far as they are not provided for in that 
action, they may be added to his costs 
incurred in the interpleader action.

reconsideration, on grounds mentioned in 
the following sections.
688. The court may, by order, modify or 
correct an award—
(a) where it appears that a part of the
award is upon a matter not referred 
to arbitration, provided such part 
can be separated from the other 
part and does not affect the 
decision on the matter referred ; or
(b) where the award is imperfect in
form, or contains any obvious error 
which can be amended without 
affecting such decision.

orders as it thinks fit respecting the costs of 
the arbitration, if any question arises 
respecting such costs and the award 
contains no sufficient provision concerning 
them.

any matter referred to arbitration to the 
reconsideration of the same arbitrators or 
umpire, upon such terms as it thinks fit—

has 
left
undetermined any of the matters 
referred to arbitration, or when it 
determines any matter not referred 
to arbitration;
(b) where the award is so indefinite as to
be incapable of execution;
(c) where an objection to the legality of
the award is apparent upon the face 
of it.
691. (1) An award 
remitted 
under 
section 690 becomes void on the refusal of 
the arbitrators or umpire to reconsider it.
(2) No award shall be set aside except- 
on one of the following grounds, namely:—

arbitrator or umpire;
(b) either party having been guilty of
fraudulent concealment of any 
matter which he ought to have 
disclosed, or of wilfully misleading 
or deceiving the arbitrator or 
umpire;
(c) the award having been made after
the issue of an order by the court 
superseding the arbitration and 
restoring the action;
and no award shall be valid unless made 
within the period allowed by the court.
692. (1) If the court sees no cause to 
remit the award or any of the matters 
referred to arbitration for reconsideration in 
manner aforesaid, and if no application has 
been made to set aside the award, or if it has 
been made and the court has refused such 
application, then the court shall, after the 
time for making such application has 
expired, on a day of which notice shall be 
given to the parties, proceed to give 
judgment according to the award ; or if the 
award has been submitted to it in the form 
of a special case, according to its own 
opinion on such case.
(2) Upon the judgment so given a decree 
shall be framed, and shall be enforced in 
manner provided in this Ordinance for the 
execution of decrees.
(3) No appeal shall lie from such decree 
except in so far as the decree is in excess of, 
or not in accordance with, the award.
693. (1) When any persons agree in 
writing that any difference between them 
shall be referred to the arbitration of any 
person named in the agreement, or to be 
appointed by any court having jurisdiction 
in the matter to which the agreement relates, 
the parties thereto, or any of them, may 
apply that the agreement be filed in such 
court.

petition entitled as of the action in which 
such grant issued, setting forth upon 
knowledge, or information and belief, any 
facts tending to show that money or other 
movable property which ought to be 
delivered to the petitioner, or which ought 
to be included in his inventory and 
valuation, is in the possession, under the 
control, or within the knowledge or 
information of a person who withholds the
same from him, or who refuses to impart 
any knowledge or information he may have 
concerning the same, or to disclose any 
other fact which will in any way aid the 
petitioner in making discovery of such 
property, so that it cannot be inventoried 
and valued; and praying an inquiry 
respecting 
it, 
and 
that 
the 
person 
complained of may be cited to attend the 
inquiry and to be examined accordingly.
(2) The petition may be accompanied by 
affidavits or other evidence tending to 
support the allegations thereof.
(3) If the court is satisfied upon the 
materials so presented that there are 
reasonable grounds for inquiry, it shall issue 
a citation accordingly, which may be made 
returnable forthwith, or at such future time 
as the court shall direct.

endorsed on, the citation an order signed by 
the Judge, requiring the person cited to

therein specified.

ineffectual unless it is accompanied with 
payment or tender of the sum required by 
law to be paid or tendered to a witness 
subpoenaed to attend a trial in a civil court.
(3) Failure to attend as required by the 
citation and order may be punished as a 
contempt of court.

intestate was in possession at the time of or 
within two years preceding his death.

at any time voluntarily file in the court from 
which grant of probate or administration 
issued to him an intermediate account, and 
the vouchers in support of the same.
724. The court may in any case at any 
time, and either upon the application of a 
creditor or party interested or of its own 
motion, make an order requiring an 
executor or administrator to render an 
intermediate account.
724A. (1) Any person interested in the 
estate may present to the court proof by 
affidavit that an executor or administrator 
has failed to file in court such account as is 
prescribed by section 553.
(2) The court shall thereupon, or of its 
own motion, if satisfied that the executor or 
administrator is in default, make order 
which shall be served on the delinquent, 
requiring him to file such final account on a 
date to be specified therein; and in default 
thereof to show cause why he should not be 
attached.
(3) Upon the day fixed in such order, if 
the delinquent has not filed a sufficient final 
account, the court may issue a warrant of 
attachment against him and deal with him 
as for contempt of court.
(4) A delinquent committed to jail under 
subsection (3) shall be discharged by the 
court upon his filing a sufficient final 
account.
(5) Every account so filed by the 
accounting party shall be in accordance with

Schedule 
with 
such 
variations 
as
circumstances may require and shall set out 
distinctly—
(a) the assets and liabilities of the
deceased

(b) receipts 
and 
disbursements 
and
transactions of property made by

party to the effect that the account contains, 
according to the best of his knowledge and 
belief, a full and true statement of all assets 
and liabilities and of all his receipts and 
disbursements on account of the estate of 
the deceased and of all money and other 
property belonging to the estate which have

(7) 
The court may reject an account 
which does not comply with the provisions 
of this section and require the executor or 
administrator to file a sufficient account 
within a specified period.
724B. (1) Where 
an 
executor 
or 
administrator files with his final account a 
receipt and discharge in the form No. 119A 
in the First Schedule (subject to such 
variations as circumstances may require) 
signed by the devisees, legatees, trustees, 
heirs, creditors or other persons entitled to 
or having an interest in the estate of the 
deceased, establishing that the entire estate 
has been duly administered and distributed, 
the court may grant him a discharge and 
enter an order that the estate has been fully 
administered.
(2) In any case where a receipt and 
discharge, or a sufficient receipt and 
discharge, is not filed with the final account 
the court may, on sufficient cause shown, 
grant further time to the executor or 
administrator to enable such a sufficient 
receipt and discharge to be filed.
(3) Where 
any 
such 
receipt 
and 
discharge has not been filed within the time 
allowed, or where any receipt and discharge 
has been refused, the court may direct that a 
copy of the final account be served upon the 
party failing or refusing to grant such 
receipt and discharge and requiring such 
person to appear in court on a day to be 
specified therein, to show cause, if any, why 
the final account should not be accepted as 
correct.
(4) Where such a person does not 
appear or upon appearance on the day so 
fixed he shows no cause against the 
acceptance of the final account the court 
shall grant a discharge to the executor or 
administrator and enter an order that the 
estate has been fully administered.
(5) Where such person contests the 
correctness or sufficiency of the account 
filed the court shall fix a date for a 
statement of objections to be filed by such
contestant 
and 
the 
executor 
or 
administrator shall, either on the date so 
fixed or prior thereto, file in court all 
receipts and vouchers in support and 
verification of the final account.
(6) The court shall inquire into such 
objections and shall make such order as the 
justice of the case may require and on the 
executor or administrator complying with 
such order discharge the executor or 
administrator and enter order declaring that 
the estate has been fully administered.
(7) Where, however, the objections are 
of such a nature that, in the opinion of the 
court, for the adjudication of the disputes 
raised therein all other parties interested in 
the estate shall have notice thereof, the 
court shall direct judicial settlement of the 
■
account in the manner provided in the 
succeeding sections.
725. In any of the following cases, and 
either upon the application of a party 
mentioned in the next section or of its own 
motion, the court may from time to time 
compel a judicial settlement of the account 
of an executor or administrator:—
(a) where one year has expired since
grant to 
him 
of probate 
or 
administration;
(b) where such grant has been revoked,
or for any other reason his powers 
have ceased;
(c) where he has sold or otherwise

any 
immovable 
property 
of 
the 
testator, 
or 
devisable interest therein, or the 
rents, profits, or proceeds thereof, 
pursuant to a power in the will, 
where one year has elapsed since 
the grant of probate to him.
726. (1) The application for a judicial 
settlement in the last section mentioned 
shall be by petition, entitled as of the action 
in which grant of probate or administration 
issued, and may be presented by a creditor,

727. 
(1) Upon the return of such 
citation, if the executor or administrator 
fails either to appear, or to show good cause 
to the contrary, or to present, in a proper 
case, a petition as prescribed in section 729, 
an order shall be made directing him to 
account within such a time and in such a 
manner as the court prescribes, and to 
attend before the court from time to time 
for that purpose. And the executor or 
administrator shall be bound by such order 
without service thereof, and if he disobeys it 
the court may issue a warrant of attachment 
against him, and the grant of probate or

persons claiming to be creditors, husband or 
wife, heirs, next of kin, and legatees (if any) 
of the testator or intestate, or, if any of 
those persons has died, his executor or 
administrator (if any), may be cited to 
attend the settlement. If one or more co­
executors or co-administrators presents such 
a petition for a settlement of his separate 
account, it must pray that his co-executors 
or co-administrators be also cited. And Citation, 
upon the presentation of any such petition a 
citation shall issue accordingly.
730. (1) Upon the return of such Hearing,

hear the allegations and proofs of the 
parties respecting the same.
(2) 
If it appears that there is a surplus, 
distributable 
to 
creditors 
or 
persons 
interested, the court may at any time issue a 
supplemental citation, directed to such 
persons as must be cited upon the petition 
of an executor or administrator for a 
judicial settlement of his account, requiring 
them to attend the accounting.
(2) Any party may contest the account 
with respect to a matter affecting his interest 
in the settlement and distribution of the 
estate; and any party may contest an 
intermediate account rendered under section 
724 in case the same has not been 
consolidated under section 728.
728. 
(1) Upon the 
return 
of any 
citation issued under any of the foregoing 
sections of this Chapter, the executor or 
administrator may, if one year has expired 
since grant of probate or administration 
issued to him, present a petition as in the 
next section prescribed.
(2) A citation issued upon such a 
petition need not be directed to the 
petitioner in the special proceeding pending 
against the executor or administrator; but

733. To each account filed under this 
Chapter shall be appended an affidavit of 
the accounting party, to the effect that the 
account contains, according to the best of 
his knowledge and belief, a full and true 
statement 
of 
all 
his 
receipts 
and 
disbursements on account of the estate of 
the testator or intestate, and of all money

order or authority for his use; and that he 
does not know of any error or omission in 
the acount to the prejudice of any creditor 
of, or person interested in, the estate.
734. Upon every accounting by an 
executor or administrator, the accounting 
party must produce and file a voucher for 
every payment, except in one of the 
following cases:—
735. The court may at any time make an Accounting 
order requiring the accounting party to P^yt0 be 
make and file his account, or to attend and exanuned' 
be examined on oath or affirmation 
touching his receipts and disbursements, or 
touching any other matter relating to his 
administration, or any act done by him
under colour of his grant or after the death 
of the testator or intestate, and before the 
issue of such grant or touching any movable 
property of the testator or intestate owned 
or held by him at the time of his death.
736. (1) Upon a judicial settlement of Court to 
the account of an executor or administrator, determine 
he may prove any debt owing to him by his clauns-
 
testator or intestate:
Provided that a concise statement of such 
debt with an intimation of the petitioner’s 
intention so to prove the same has been 
inserted in the petition.
(1) He may be allowed, without a 
voucher, 
any 
proper 
item 
of 
expenditure, not exceeding twenty 
rupees, if it is supported by his own 
uncontradicted oath or affirmation, 
stating 
positively 
the 
fact 
of 
payment and specifying where and 
to whom the payment was made:
Provided that all the items so 
allowed against an estate, upon all 
the accountings of all the executors 
or administrators, shall not exceed 
two hundred rupees.
(2) If he proves, by his own or another’s 
sworn testimony, that he did not 
take a voucher when he made the 
payment, or that the voucher then 
taken by him has been lost or 
destroyed, he may be allowed any 
item of which he satisfactorily 
proves 
the 
payment 
by 
the 
testimony of the person to whom he 
made it, or, if that person is dead or 
cannot be found, by any competent 
evidence other than his own or his 
wife’
s oath or affirmation.
(2) Where a contest arises between the 
accounting party and any of the other 
parties respecting any property alleged to 
belong to the estate, but to which the 
accounting party lays claim, or respecting a 
debt alleged to be due by the accounting 
party to the testator or intestate, or by the 
testator or intestate to the accounting party, 
the contest must be tried and determined in 
the same special proceeding and in the same 
manner as any issue arising on a civil trial.
737. From the death of the testator or Prescription, 
intestate until the first judicial settlement 
of an 
account 
by 
the 
executor 
or 
administrator, the running of the Ordinance 
relating to the prescription of actions 
against a debt due from the deceased to the 
accounting party, or any other cause of 
action in favour of the latter against the 
deceased, 
is 
suspended, 
unless 
the 
accounting party was appointed upon the 
revocation of a former grant to another 
person; in which case the running of the 
Ordinance is so suspended from the grant to 
him until the first judicial settlement of his 
account. After the first judicial settlement of 
the account of an executor or administrator, 
the Ordinance begins again to run against a 
debt due to him from the deceased, or any 
other cause of action in his favour against 
the deceased.
But no such item shall be allowed unless 
the court is satisfied that the charge is 
correct and just.

property of the testator or intestate perished 
or lost without the fault of the accounting 
party.
739. A judicial settlement under this 
Chapter, either by the decree of the District 
Court or upon an appeal therefrom, is 
conclusive evidence against all parties.who 
were duly cited or appeared, and all persons 
deriving title from any of them at any time, 
of the following facts, and no others:—
(а) that the items allowed to the
accounting party for money paid to 
creditors, legatees, heirs, and next 
of kin, for necessary expenses, and 
for his services are correct;
(б) that the accounting party has been
charged with all the interest for 
money 
received 
by 
him 
and 
embraced in the account, for which 
he was legally accountable;
(c) that the money charged to the
accounting party, as collected, is all 
that was collectible at the time of 
the settlement on the debts stated in 
the account;
(d) that .the allowances made to the
accounting party for the decrease, 
and the charges against him for the 
increase, in the value of property 
were correctly made.
740. (1) When an account is judicially 
settled under the provisions of this Chapter, 
and any part of the estate remains and is 
ready to be distributed to the creditors, 
legatees, heirs, next of kin, husband, or wife 
of the testator or intestate, or their assigns, 
the decree must direct the payment and 
distribution thereof to the persons so 
entitled, according to their respective rights.
(2) If any person who is a necessary 
party for that purpose has not been cited, or 
has not appeared, a supplemental citation 
must be issued as prescribed in section 727.
(3) Where the validity of a debt, claim, 
or distributive share is not disputed, or has 
been established, the decree must determine 
to whom it is payable, the sum to be paid, 
and all other questions concerning the same.
And such decree shall be conclusive with 
respect to the matters enumerated in this 
section upon each party to the special 
proceedings 
who 
was 
duly 
cited 
or 
appeared, and upon every person deriving 
title from such party.
741. (1) In either of the following cases 
the decree may direct the delivery of unsold 
property, movable or immovable, or the 
assignment of an uncollected demand, or 
any other movable property, to a party or 
parties entitled to payment or distribution in 
lieu of the money value of the property:—
(a) where all the parties interested, who
have 
appeared, 
manifest 
their 
consent thereto by a writing filed in 
court;
(b) where it appears that a sale thereof,
for the purpose of payment of 
distribution would cause a loss to 
the parties entitled thereto.
(2) The value must be ascertained, if the 
consent does not fix it, by an appraisement 
under oath made by one or more persons 
appointed by the court for the purpose.
742. Where an admitted debt of the 
testator or intestate is not yet due, and the 
creditor will not accept present payment 
with a rebate of interest, or where an action 
is 
pending 
between 
the 
executor 
or 
administrator and a person claiming to be a 
creditor of the deceased, the decree must 
direct that a sum sufficient to satisfy the 
claim, or the proportion to which it is 
entitled, together with the probable amount 
of the interest and costs, be retained in the 
hands of the accounting party, or paid into 
court for the purpose of being applied to the 
payment of the claim when it is due, 
recovered, or settled; and that so much 
thereof as is not needed for that purpose be 
afterwards distributed according to law.
743. Where a legacy or distributive 
share is payable to a person of unsound 
mind or a minor, the decree may, in the 
discretion of the court, direct it to be paid to

complying with those provisions; and
Provided also that it appears to the Court 
of Appeal that the petitioner has a good 
ground of appeal, and that nothing has

petition of appeal to be admitted upon such' 
conditions as to costs, security, or otherwise 
as to the court may seem just, and in the 
event of its doing so the Registrar shall, 
where the court of first instance is the Court 
of Appeal, proceed as in section 768 
provided ; but where such court is a District 
Court, Family Court or Primary Court, the 
Court of Appeal shall issue a mandate to 
such court, directing it to forward to the 
Court of Appeal the 
record of the 
proceedings of the action in which the
