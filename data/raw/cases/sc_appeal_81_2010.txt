Suresh Chandra J,
This is an appeal from an order of the Court of Appeal dated 21st January 2010 refusing an 
application  made by the Plaintiff- Respondent –Appellant to the Court of Appeal to revise an 
Order made by the High Court of the Western Province (Holden in Colombo exercising Civil 
Jurisdiction) in terms of S.328 of the Civil Procedure Code.  
This case originated in the District Court and was transferred to the Commercial High Court. The 
‘Victoria Building’ Pettah was constructed on state Land which had been leased to J.A.D.Victoria 
for 99 years in 1928. The said J.A.D.Victoria had assigned his leasehold rights to the 1st 
Defendant-Respondent-Respondent  in  or  around  the  year  1992.  The  1st,  2nd,  3rd and  4th 
Respondents were the tenants of the said Victoria and they became the tenants of the 1st 
Defendant upon the said assignment. The 1st Defendant mortgaged the said leasehold rights to the 
Appellant on 18th December 1992. In or around 1993, the 1st Defendant instituted actions in the 
District Court against the 1st to 4th Respondents who were in occupation of the different parts of 
the said Victoria building and sought to have them ejected. The 1st Defendant also sought and 
obtained enjoining orders and corresponding interim injunctions restraining the said respondents 
from obstructing the 1st Defendant from carrying out repairs to the said building. Pursuant to the 
obtaining of the said enjoining orders the 1st Defendant ejected the Respondents from the said 
building. Shortly thereafter there had been a fire in the said building. Thereupon the District 
court had suspended the said enjoining orders  and the Respondents had been restored to 
possession. Thereafter all four actions had been dismissed and in the actions filed against the 1st 
and 2nd Respondents, they were declared to be the tenants of their respective premises and 
damages were awarded to them for wrongful dispossession. 
In the meantime as the 1st Defendant had defaulted in the payments due on the mortgage and the 
Petitioner instituted action against the 1st defendant for the recovery of the monies due on the 
said  mortgage  and  for  the  enforcement  of  the  mortgage  bond.  The  mortgage  action  was 
transferred to the Commercial High court and the 1st and 2nd Defendants consented to judgment 
therein and thereafter the petitioner purchased the said premises at the sale conducted consequent 
to the said judgment. On being made aware of the said mortgage decree, the Respondents sought 
to intervene in the said action to safeguard their rights, but their application to intervene was 
refused. The Registrar of the High court was notified by the Attorney-at-Law for the 1st, 2nd and 
3rd Respondents about the judgments that had been given in their favour by the District Court in 
respect of their tenancy in the said building and that any steps to have them ejected would be 
resisted by the said Respondents. The Appellant by way of a motion made an application for an 
order to eject those persons who were residing in the said premises and for delivery of possession 
thereof to the Appellants. The High court allowed the said application and writ was executed on 
14.10.2005 and the  Appellant obtained vacant possession  of the premises  by ejecting  the 
Respondents. 
Thereafter the Respondents made applications for restoration of possession and damages under 
section 328 of the Civil Procedure Code which was allowed by the High Court on 15th June 2006 
restoring the Respondents to possession of the premises and with damages in their favour. The 
Appellant being aggrieved by the said Order of the Learned Judge of the Commercial High Court 
filed a Revision Application No. CA Rev (PHC) APN 81/2006 in the Court of Appeal to have the 
said order revised. 
A preliminary objection was taken on behalf of the Respondents at the hearing of the Revision 
Application before the Court of Appeal on the ground that the said Application could not be 
maintained in law as a right of Appeal was available to the Petitioner against the said order to the 
Supreme Court under S.5 of the High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act No.10 of 
1996 which right of appeal had not been exercised by the Appellant. Written submissions were 
tendered by both parties in relation to the said preliminary objection and the Court of Appeal 
delivered the Order dismissing the Revision Application of the Petitioner on 21st January 2010 
holding that the Right of Appeal granted to the Apex Court by the said Act No.10 of 1996 cannot 
be offended by S.329 of the Civil Procedure Code which states that there is no Right of Appeal 
against orders made under S.326 or S.327 and that the Petitioner had failed to exercise the said 
Right  of  Appeal  to  the  Supreme  Court  and  that  the  Court  of  Appeal  could  not  exercise 
Revisionary Jurisdiction against the said Order. The Court of Appeal in the course of its 
judgment cited the decision in Australanka Exporters Pvt Ltd v Indian Bank 2001 (2) S.L.R. 156 
where it was held that the Appellate jurisdiction in respect of Judgments and orders of the High 
court of the Provinces made in the exercise of its civil jurisdiction was vested exclusively in the 
Supreme Court.  
The Appellants made an application for special leave to appeal against the said Order of the 
Court of Appeal and leave was granted to the Appellant on the following questions :
i)
Are  the  provisions  contained  in  S.5  of  the  High  Court  of  the  Provinces  (Special 
Provisions) Act No.10 of 1996 which grant a right of appeal against any order made 
by such High Court a general provision which should be interpreted subject to the 
provisions set out in S.329 of the Civil Procedure Code when Order is made by such a 
High Court under S.326 or S.327 or S.328 of the Civil Procedure Code?
ii) Does S.5(2) of the said Act No.10 of 1996 grant a right of appeal in law contrary to the 
provisions of S.329 of the Civil Procedure Code when an Order is made by such a 
High Court under S.326 or S.327 or S.328 of the Civil Procedure Code?
iii) Is the said Order of the Court of Appeal wrong in law?
iv) Does S.329 of the Civil Procedure Code have no application to the right of appeal granted 
by S.5 of the said Act No.10 of 1996?
v) If so, is the judgment of the Court of Appeal correct in law?
Before  the  enactment  of  Act  No.10of  1996  it  was  the  District  Court  that  exercised 
jurisdiction in respect of civil matters and the Civil Procedure Code laid down the procedure 
to be followed in the District Courts regarding original jurisdiction and by the Court of 
Appeal regarding appellate and revisionary jurisdiction. By the High Court of the Provinces 
(Special Provisions) Act No.10 of 1996, High Courts were conferred Civil Jurisdiction to 
hear and determine certain Civil actions and matters. It would be pertinent to examine the 
relevant provisions of the said Act regarding the jurisdiction conferred on the High Court and 
the review of orders and judgments of such Courts. 
S.2(1) : Every High Court established by Article 154P of the Constitution for a Province 
shall, with effect from such date as the Minister may, by Order published in the Gazette 
appoint, in respect of such High Court have exclusive jurisdiction and shall have cognizance 
of and full power to hear and determine, in the manner provided for by written law, all 
actions, applications and proceedings specified in the First Schedule to this Act, if the party 
or parties defendant to such action reside or reside, or the cause of action has arisen, or the 
contract sought to be enforced was made, or in the case of applications or proceedings under 
the Companies Act, No.17 of 1982 the registered office of the Company is situated  with the 
Province for which such High Court is established. 
S. 2(3) The High court established by Article 154P of the Constitution for the Western 
Province shall with effect from such date as the Minister by order published in the Gazette 
appoint, have exclusive jurisdiction and shall have cognizance of, and full power to hear and 
determine in the manner provided for by written law, all matters set out in the Second 
Schedule to this Act.
The expression “in the manner provided for by written law” would bring in the provisions of 
the Civil Procedure Code in respect of the invocation of original jurisdiction and the 
procedure relating to the exercise of that jurisdiction. The question would then arise as to 
whether the whole of the Civil Procedure Code has been incorporated impliedly regarding 
the civil jurisdiction of the High Court. The other provisions of Act No.10 of 1996, namely S. 
4, 5(3)  and 6 would show that it is not so. S.4 makes the provisions of Chapter XXI of the 
Civil Procedure Code relating to the award of costs applicable to the High Court. S.5(3) 
makes the provisions of S.754(5) of the Civil Procedure Code applicable and S.6 in laying 
down the procedure for appeals to the supreme Court from the High Court provides that 
every appeal and every application for leave to appeal under S.5 shall be made as nearly as 
may be in accordance with the procedure prescribed by Chapter LVIII of the Civil Procedure 
Code.  Thus  only certain  provisions  of the  Civil  Procedure  Code have  been  expressly 
incorporated in Act No.10 of 1996.    
The Right of Appeal from a judgment or order of the High Court exercising civil jurisdiction 
is laid down in S.5 of the said Act. 
S.5( 1) Any person who is dissatisfied with any judgment pronounced by a High court 
established by Article 154P of the constitution, in the exercise of its jurisdiction under 
section2 in any action, proceeding or matter to which such person is a party may prefer an 
appeal to the Supreme Court against such judgment, for any error in fact or in law.    
S.5 (2) of the said Act No.10 of 1996 provides that:  
“Any person who is dissatisfied with any order made by a High Court established by Article 
154P of the Constitution in the exercise of its jurisdiction under S.2 in the course of any 
action, proceeding or matter to which such person is, or seeks to be, a party, may prefer an 
appeal to the Supreme Court against such Order for the correction of any error in fact or law, 
with the leave of the Supreme Court first had and obtained.”
Thus it would be seen that S.5(1) provides for an appeal to the Supreme Court against a 
judgment of the High court while S.5(2) provides for an appeal to the Supreme Court with 
the leave of the Supreme court first had and obtained. 
A comparison of the provisions of Chapter LVIII of the Civil Procedure Code with Section 5 
and 6 of Act No.10 of 1996 would show that the provisions of S.754(1) and (2) have not been 
incorporated into the said Act and have been replaced by Sections 5(1) and (2) while Sections 
753(3), 753(4), 754(5) and Sections 755-760A of the Civil Procedure Code, which lay down 
the procedure regarding appeals , have been incorporated into the Act by S.6 by stating that 
such procedure shall be made as nearly as may be in accordance with the procedure 
prescribed by Chapter LVIII of the Civil Procedure code.    
It would be seen therefore that in conferring civil jurisdiction on the High Court by Act. 
No.10 of 1996, that the entirety of the Civil Procedure Code has not been incorporated into 
the said Act and that only specific provisions of the Civil Procedure code have been 
incorporated into the said Act. Of particular relevance is the fact that section 329 of the civil 
Procedure code has not been referred to in the said Act No.10 of 1996. 
Section 329 of the Civil Procedure Code provides that :
“No appeal shall lie from an order made under S.326 or S.327 or S.328 against any party 
other than the judgment-debtor. Any such order shall not bar the right of such party to 
institute an action to establish his right or title to such property.”
Prior to 1996 an Appeal was possible from the District Court (except where excluded like 
S.329) to the Court of Appeal and then to the Supreme Court. After the enactment of Act 
No.10 of 1996, an appeal in relation to judgments and orders of the High Court in the 
exercise of its civil jurisdiction is granted only to the Supreme Court under S.5 of Act No.10 
of 1996. 
For the purposes of the present case, it would be necessary to consider the effect of S.329 of 
the Civil Procedure Code on S.5 of the High Court Act. S.329 placed a limitation on the right 
of appeal granted by Sections 754(1) and (2)but as far as S.5 of the Act is concerned S.329 
does  not  place  any such  limitation  as  stated  above  Ss.754(1)  and  (2)  have  not  been 
incorporated in to the Act and have in fact been replaced by Sections 5(1) and (2) of the Act.
The Appellants submit that since there is no right of appeal possible in terms of S.329 of the 
Civil Procedure Code that a Revision application would be possible to the Court of Appeal. 
In support of that contention the Petitioners submit that the maxim “Generalia Specialibus 
non derogant” would apply. As far as S.754 of the Civil Procedure Code is concerned this 
maxim would apply in proceedings before the Court of Appeal, being the same statute as 
S.329 takes away the right of appeal to the Court of Appeal granted by S.754. However, 
when section 329 of the Civil Procedure Code is viewed against S.5 of the High Court of 
Provinces (Special Provisions) Act No. 10 of 1996 the maxim would not apply as two 
different Statutes, namely the Civil Procedure Code and Act No.10 of 1996 are involved.    
 Bindra on  Interpretation of Statutes, 10th Edition points out at pg 555 and 556 that 
“Where two Acts are inconsistent or repugnant, the latest expressions of the will of the 
Legislature must prevail provided that the Court is satisfied that the repeal of the prior 
enactment must flow from necessary implication.”
In the judgment of Lord Langdale MR, in Dean of Ely v Bliss (1842) 11 LJ Ch 351, p354 it 
was held that 
“If two inconsistent Acts be passed at different times, the last is to be obeyed, and if 
obedience cannot be observed without derogating from the first, it is the first which must 
give away. Every Act of Parliament must be considered with reference to the state of law 
subsisting when it came into operation, and when it is to be applied, it cannot otherwise be 
rationally construed. Every act is made either for the purpose of making a change in law, or 
for the purpose of better declaring the law, and its operation is not to be impeded by the mere 
fact that it is inconsistent with some previous enactment.”
The Maxim  - expressio unius est exclusion alterius - "the express mention of one thing 
excludes all others", fortifies the conclusion that review is available only from the  Supreme 
Court in terms of S.5 of the High Court Act. 
It is observed that Ss. 88,329 and 692(3) of the Civil Procedure Code are special provisions 
which   deny the Right of Appeal. These are situations where inquiries are done in the 
Preliminary Courts in special circumstances conferring rights to the individuals and from 
these inquiries the right to appeal has been denied apparently as the Court is required to 
inquire into the matter before Court twice over. In those circumstances the remedy available 
was that of Revision. But with the introduction of the High Court Act conferring civil 
jurisdiction to the High Court in certain matters the mode of review in such situations would 
be in accordance with the provisions of S.5. 
The sequence of the enactment of the Acts makes it evident that in relation to a matter in the 
District Court the Right to Appeal from a judgment would be to the Court of Appeal and then 
if leave is granted an appeal would lie to the Supreme Court. By the enactment of Act No.10 
of 1996 it is clear that in any civil matter dealt with in the High Court, the Right of Appeal 
lies only to the Supreme Court. This seems to be the clear intention of the Legislature with 
regard to matters dealt in the High Court. When the above special provisions are being 
considered in the High Court, if revisionary jurisdiction to the Court of Appeal is given then 
it would give the party applying for revision in a situation as in the present case a favourable 
position by granting an additional opportunity of review as against a party who comes within 
the purview of the civil jurisdiction of the High Court regarding other matters as they will be 
entitled only to the right to appeal to the Supreme Court. This would be due to the fact that if 
the revisionary jurisdiction to the Court of Appeal is allowed then if need be the party would 
have the option to go further to the Supreme Court by way of canvassing the judgment of the 
Court of Appeal in such instances. This would give the party in such circumstances two 
opportunities  of  review  of  the  preliminary  judgment  when  the  clear  intention  of  the 
Legislature is that there should be only an appeal to the Supreme Court from any judgment or 
order of the High Court in the exercise of its Civil Jurisdiction in terms of Sections 5(1) and 
5(2). Further it would be illogical to consider that a party is entitled to have recourse to the 
Court  of  Appeal  to  exercise  its  Revisionary  jurisdiction  (and  consequently  an  appeal 
therefrom to the Supreme Court) if it is in relation to a matter under S.329 where an appeal is 
denied, while an appeal is available to a party only to the Supreme Court in other matters 
where the High Court has been granted civil jurisdiction. 
The Court of Appeal expressed a similar view as above in Australanka exporters case in 
relation to S.88 of the Civil Procedure Code where again a right of appeal is denied. There a 
hypothecary action was instituted in the Commercial High Court of Colombo to recover a 
sum of money lent to the defendant. The defendant defaulted in appearing before the court 
and an ex parte decree was entered. The application to purge the default was dismissed. 
Thereafter the defendant made an application to the Court of the Appeal to have the order of 
the High Court revised.  It was held that the Appellate Jurisdiction in respect of judgments 
and orders of the High Court of the Provinces made in the exercise of its civil jurisdiction is 
vested exclusively in the Supreme Court.
Therefore the questions of law on which leave was granted by this Court are answered as 
follows: 
Question 1:  The provisions of S.5 of the High Court of the Provinces (Special provisions) 
Act No.10 of 1996 is not subject to the provisions of S.329 of the Civil Procedure Code when 
an order is made by such a High Court under S.326 or S.327 or S328 of the Civil Procedure 
Code.
Question 2: S.5(2) of the said Act No.10 of 1996 grants a right of appeal to the Supreme 
Court with leave from an order made by such a High Court under s.326 or S.327 or s.328 of 
the Civil procedure Code and is not contrary to S.329 of the Civil Procedure code.
Question 3: The Order of the Court of Appeal is not wrong in law as it is in keeping with the 
objective of the provisions of High Court Act No.10 of 1996 of granting an appeal only to the 
Supreme Court when conferring civil jurisdiction on certain matters to the High Court.
Question 4: S. 329 of the Civil Procedure Code has no application to the right of appeal 
granted by S.5 of the said Act No.10 of 1996.
Question 5: The judgment of the Court of Appeal is correct in law as it has held that the 
exclusive right of appeal from an order or judgment of the High Court exercising civil 
jurisdiction is vested with the Supreme Court.   
In the above circumstances the appeal of the Appellants is dismissed with costs fixed at 
Rs.31,500/-.
